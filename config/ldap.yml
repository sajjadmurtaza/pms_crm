# Config file for local LDAP settings.
# Your local LDAP can be used to pre-populate information
# about a User in Heyday. This means you won't have to
# type in all their information by hand!
#
# Connection settings (required):
#   'host' => Host of local LDAP server
#   'port' => Port of local LDAP server (usually port 389)
#   'base' => Base Distinguished Name (Base DN) which Heyday
#             will search for user matching a particular username.
#             This is usually similar to "dc=test,dc=com".
#
# Institution-specific mappings (required):
#   Since LDAP schema elements may vary from case to case,
#   you must set the appropriate mappings. (e.g., middlename: myuMiddleName)
#   NB: only 'uid', 'cn', 'sn', and 'mail' are required
#
#   'uid'                 => Unique identifer (e.g., sAMAccountName for AD)
#   'cn'                  => Common name (useful lookup forms of name)
#   'givenname            => First name
#   'sn'                  => Last name
#   'middlename'          => Middle name
#   'generationqualifier' => Name suffix (e.g., Jr, Sr, III)
#   'displayname'         => Prefered display name
#   'ou'                  => Organizational unit (department)
#   'title'               => Title
#   'postaladdress'       => Postal address
#   'mail'                => Email address
#   'telephone'           => Telephone number
#
# Authentication settings (optional):
#   'username'   => Only use if required for LDAP bind
#   'password'   => Only use if required for LDAP bind
